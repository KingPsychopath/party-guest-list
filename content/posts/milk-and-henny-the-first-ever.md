Some things you plan. Other things just happen to you.

Milk & Henny was supposed to be a birthday party. A night out with friends, good music, a dress code nobody would follow. The kind of thing you throw together in a group chat and hope for the best.

But somewhere between booking the venue and arguing about the playlist, it became something else. It became a *thing*. A real thing with a name and a logo and people asking "when's the next one?"

## The night itself

Four DJs. Two MCs. One rule: if someone says no, it means no.

ELLADHC opened. SATRA-SIA followed. AYCHIBS brought the energy up, and DJNAIRAA closed it out. D CHIEF EXECUTIVE and FADZ held the mic down all night.

We had an ice breaker game where you matched with someone wearing your colour. We had a best-dressed vote that got way too competitive. We had a guest list app that I built the week before because I couldn't stop overthinking.

## What I learned

Building something for people you care about hits different. Every detail matters more. You're not shipping a feature — you're making sure your friend's name is spelled right on the list.

The tech stack was Next.js, Tailwind, and Vercel. The real stack was group chats, favours, and blind optimism.

## What's next

I don't know yet. But I kept the domain.

If you were there — thank you. If you weren't — next time.
