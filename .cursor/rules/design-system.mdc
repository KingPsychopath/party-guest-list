# Milk & Henny Design System

If a task includes semantics, keyboard support, focus handling, forms, or screen-reader behavior, also load `.cursor/rules/accessibility.mdc`.

## Aesthetic: "Editorial Typewriter"
- Writing-first. Single column, max-w-2xl. No sidebars or widgets.
- UI chrome (nav, dates, labels): Geist Mono, lowercase, tight tracking.
- Prose (titles, body): Lora serif.
- Warm stone palette. Amber accent. Never blue-grey.
- Dark mode: deep warm brown, not blue-black.
- Subtle interactions: opacity shifts, not colour changes.

## Layout
- Max width: max-w-2xl (672px), px-6 padding.
- Generous vertical spacing. Hairline `border-t theme-border` dividers.

## Colours
- Use CSS custom properties (`var(--foreground)`, `var(--stone-400)`).
- Never hardcode hex in components.
