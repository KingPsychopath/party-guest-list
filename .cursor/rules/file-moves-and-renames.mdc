# File moves + renames

When moving or renaming files, do not copy/paste code into a new file. Move/rename the file on disk using terminal commands so history stays intact and the change is less error-prone.

## Default workflow

- Prefer `git mv old/path.ts new/path.ts` (repo is git); use `mv` if appropriate.
- After the move, immediately fix all imports/usages (components, routes, tests, scripts).
- Verify there are no remaining references to the old path (use `rg` on the old path / old symbol).
- Clean up empty folders left behind (delete only directories that are truly empty).

## Guardrails

- Avoid destructive deletes; only remove directories after confirming they contain no files.
- If a move affects public APIs/routes, double-check path-based behavior and tests.
