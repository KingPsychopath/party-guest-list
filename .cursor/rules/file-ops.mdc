# File Operations

## Moves & Renames
- Use `git mv` (not copy/paste) to preserve history.
- Fix all imports/usages immediately after move.
- Verify with `rg` that no old-path references remain.
- Clean up empty directories.

## Sweeping Edits / Codemods
- Inventory first (`rg` for old patterns).
- Prefer AST-aware transforms (ts-morph/jscodeshift).
- Support dry-run mode.
- Do not apply broad global search/replace on arbitrary content.
