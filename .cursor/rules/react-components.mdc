# React components

- Use functional components only.
- Keep components small and focused; extract custom hooks to encapsulate related state/behavior.
- Use early returns to reduce nesting.
- Avoid `useMemo`/`useCallback`/`React.memo` unless there's a measured need.

## Naming

- Components: PascalCase; hooks: `useX`; event handlers: `onVerb` (props) / `handleVerb` (internal)
- Booleans: `is*` / `has*` / `should*`
